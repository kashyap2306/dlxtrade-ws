RECOMMENDATION:
==============
Use CoinMarketCap as backup provider to CryptoCompare.

- Mark as enabledByDefault: true
- No API key field (free tier doesn't require key)
- Add attribution requirement note
- Rate limit: 10K calls/month

If no free provider qualifies, remove CryptoCompare-FreeMode-1 and CryptoCompare-FreeMode-2 entries.
